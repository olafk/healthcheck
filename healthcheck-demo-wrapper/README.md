# Demo Wrapper for Healthchecks

This is a wrapper project that wraps the 
[Demo Checklist Plugin](https://github.com/olafk/demo-checklist-web/) 
(with relaxed security requirements) to the Healthcheck framework. It requires the linked project to be deployed too.

Note that those demo-checks might degrade the security of your installation (e.g. demanding a relaxed password policy) due to the nature of its requirements, namely easing demonstrations.
