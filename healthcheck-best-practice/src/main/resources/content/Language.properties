healthcheck-best-practice-configuration-name=Healthcheck Best Practices
healthcheck-best-practice-configuration-description=Configure threshold values for the Best Practices healthchecks
healthcheck-best-practice-maximum-simple-store-files-name=File Threshold for SimpleFileStore
healthcheck-best-practice-maximum-simple-store-files-description=SimpleFileStore is limited by the number of files your OS can store in a single directory (file system dependent). Configure the threshold that you consider too high for your system.
healthcheck-best-practice-doclib-minimum-usable-space-name=Doclib minimum available diskspace
healthcheck-best-practice-doclib-minimum-usable-space-description=If the doclib is stored in a file system, specify the minimum amount of usable diskspace that must always be available before triggering an alert
healthcheck-bestpractice-default-account-with-default-password=The default credentials ("test") for a long known default user "test@liferay.com" should not be present (even deactivated)
healthcheck-category-best-practice=Best Practice
healthcheck-locale-properties=Configured locales look good (language with country code, and they're available in the JVM)
healthcheck-locale-properties-length=Detected problematic locale in section {0}, value {1} (checked for at least 5 characters in language code)
healthcheck-locale-properties-diff=Detected problematic locale in section {0}, value {1} not found in available locales
healthcheck-simple-file-store-ok=You're using the default SimpleFileStore in {2}, which is limited in its size. Currently, you're at {0}, which looks good. Starting at {1} files (configurable) this check will fail and suggest a different store.
healthcheck-simple-file-store-too-many-files=You're using the default SimpleFileStore in {2}, which is limited in its size. Currently you're at {0}, which makes it worth thinking about upgrading to AdvancedFileSystemStore (configurable threshold: {1})
healthcheck-simple-file-store-unused=You're not using SimpleFileStore, so you're not affected by its limits.
healthcheck-simple-file-store-no-dir=The configured rootDirectory for SimpleFileStore ({0}) is not a directory.
healthcheck-simple-file-store-usable-space=The storage directory for the SimpleFileStore should have at least {0} bytes free. Currently free: {1}
healthcheck-password-hashing-rounds-owasp-recommendation=According to OWASP (or your configuration), password hashing with PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 should have at least {1} rounds. You have configured {0}.
healthcheck-best-practice-pbkdf2-user-unconfigured-algorithm=Undetected Password Hashing Algorithm
healthcheck-best-practice-pbkdf2-unknown-hashing-algorithm-assuming-ok=Unknown Password Hashing Algorithm {0}. This check is built for PBKDF2 - if you've configured something else, it won't complain - you might know better. 
healthcheck-best-practice-pbkdf2-found-x-entries-with-default-algorithm-y=Found {0} user record(s) with the currently configured password hashing algorithm {1}
healthcheck-best-practice-pbkdf2-found-x-entries-with-nondefault-algorithm-y-looking-for-z=Found {0} user record(s) with the unexpected password hashing algorithm {1} (likely legacy) while looking for {2}
healthcheck-best-practice-user-count-mismatch-x-uncounted=Mismatch counting password hashing algorithms. The difference between actual and counted users is {0}
